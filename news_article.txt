            The US government will not negotiate with people accused of attacking or vandalizing Teslas and Tesla dealerships, Attorney General Pam Bondi said during a Cabinet meeting today.
    
            “And you know, you also gave us a directive to prosecute the people who are going after Tesla, to the fullest extent of the law, some of the greatest police work I’ve seen. We’ve made four arrests,” Bondi said while addressing President Donald Trump at the meeting.
    
                    “There will be no negotiations at your directive,” she said. “They’re all looking at 20 years in prison.”
                

            Bondi’s statement seemed to indicate the government won’t engage in plea negotiations that could potentially reduce that 20-year sentence.
    
            Trump has described people who vandalize Teslas as domestic terrorists. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is Trump’s largest donor and is heading the administration’s efforts to reduce the size of the government.
    
            The FBI last month launched a task force investigating a spate of instances of vandalism that have targeted Teslas and Tesla dealerships across the country.
